# STATUS — session handoff

Last updated **2026-07-29**. Read this first, then `ENGINE_NOTES.md`.

## Where the project is

A **working, wearable VR mod** for Singularity (2010, Unreal Engine 3, D3D9, x86):

- The game renders into the Quest via OpenXR, with correct colours
- **3-DOF head tracking** drives the in-game view (pitch and yaw)
- Ships as one `d3d9.dll` dropped beside the game exe — no game files modified

Current build: **`spikes/view_matrix/`** (spike 9) — everything below plus the camera-position
probe. **`spikes/vr_render/`** (spike 8) is the known-good fallback if spike 9 misbehaves.
Earlier spikes are kept deliberately; several document approaches that did *not* work, which is
most of their value.

## Quick start

```powershell
.\spikes\view_matrix\build.ps1 -Install     # builds x86, copies into the dev game copy
```

Connect **Virtual Desktop** first (VDXR is the only usable 32-bit OpenXR runtime — Meta's own
crashes in `xrCreateSession`, SteamVR has no 32-bit runtime at all), then launch:

```
R:\SingularityVR-Dev\Singularity\Binaries\Singularity.exe
```

In gameplay: **F9** head tracking · **F8** recentre · **F5/F4** flip yaw/pitch sign ·
**F7** scan for the view matrix · **F3** offset the camera through it · **F11** offset amount.
Log: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SingularityVR\view_matrix.log`. Uninstall = delete `d3d9.dll`.

Paths, toolchain and game copies: `ENVIRONMENT.md`. Nothing is tied to the repo location.

## What works, and how

| Piece | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Frame into the headset | backbuffer → `GetRenderTargetData` → SYSTEMMEM → D3D11 → XR swapchain |
| View **pitch** | MinHook detour on `FUN_0104e390`, the view-rotation source |
| View **yaw** | direct write to the live controller `+0x64` (the detour's seam carries pitch only) |
| FOV | write to `mCurrentPOV` FOV, `+0x0438` |
| Finding live objects | `GObjects` walk; live actor = `Outer == PersistentLevel`, name lacks `Default__` |

## ✅ Camera POSITION — solved 2026-07-29

This was the blocker for **both 6-DOF and stereo**, and it is now controllable. Not through the
engine's object model — three attempts at that failed — but by intercepting the **world→clip
matrix** on its way to the GPU and pre-multiplying a translation into it. Confirmed live: the
view moved.

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Where | `SetVertexShaderConstantF`, device vtable slot 94 |
| Register | `c0`, ROW storage (registers are matrix rows) |
| Space | **translated-world** — UE3 pre-subtracts the view origin on the CPU |
| To move by `o` | `row3 -= o.x*row0 + o.y*row1 + o.z*row2` |

Two findings from the same run, both in `ENGINE_NOTES.md`:

- **The engine renders in translated-world space.** Probing the world camera position alone
  would have found nothing; the origin probe is what made the scan work.
- **CPU frustum culling clips the offset view** — a black band at the frame edge, because
  geometry newly visible after the offset was culled before it was ever drawn. The fix is to
  make the game render wider than it displays; `mCurrentPOV` FOV at `+0x0438` is proven
  writable and is the lever. At real IPD scale (a few UU, not the 300 UU used for the proof)
  this should be close to negligible.

### ⏭ Next actions

1. **Step the offset down** (F11 cycles 300 / 100 / 30 / 10 / 3 UU) and find where the culling
   band stops mattering. This sizes the FOV-widening job, or removes it.
2. **Widen the render FOV** via `mCurrentPOV +0x0438` so the margin covers the offset.
3. **Get two images per frame** — the remaining piece for real stereo. The architecture renders
   once per frame, so this needs alternate-eye submission (one frame stale per eye, cheap),
   engine re-entry (proper, hard), or depth reprojection (fallback).
4. **6-DOF** is now mostly free: feed the HMD's positional delta in as the offset instead of a
   constant.

## Other known work, roughly by value

- **Performance** — the frame copy is a full CPU round-trip (~14 MB each way at 2560×1440).
  The fast path needs the game's device upgraded to D3D9Ex, which needs a
  `D3DPOOL_MANAGED` → `DEFAULT` wrapper (**10,454** allocations measured in spike 2).
- **FOV / aspect mismatch** — game renders 16:9, per-eye view is ~2496×2688.
- **Head-look vs aim are coupled** — `PlayerController.Rotation` drives both view and fire trace.
- **Menus are inert** — intended; they need OpenXR *input* (controllers, thumbsticks, laser
  pointer), which has not been touched at all. Same work unlocks motion-controller aiming.
- **GOG install crash** — a latent Raven bug (unchecked NULL from a factory) that hits on a fresh
  GOG install with missing redistributables. The install guide must warn about it.

## Method notes that earned their keep

- **Verify by writing, not by reading.** A struct holding plausible live values is not proof the
  renderer uses it. `mCurrentPOV` looked exactly like the camera and steers only FOV.
- **When guessing fails twice, change tools.** A hardware write breakpoint found the rotation
  source immediately after seven failed guesses.
- **Shotgun, then narrow.** Testing candidates one at a time behind a hotkey let a working case
  get cycled past unseen.
- **Doc errors become code bugs.** `ENGINE_NOTES` recorded the backbuffer as `X8R8G8B8`; it is
  `A8R8G8B8`, and that mistake propagated straight into a `D3DERR_INVALIDCALL`.
