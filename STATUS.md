# STATUS — session handoff

Last updated **2026-07-29**. Read this first, then `ENGINE_NOTES.md`.

## Where the project is

A **working, wearable VR mod** for Singularity (2010, Unreal Engine 3, D3D9, x86):

- The game renders into the Quest via OpenXR, with correct colours
- **3-DOF head tracking** drives the in-game view (pitch and yaw)
- Ships as one `d3d9.dll` dropped beside the game exe — no game files modified

Current build: **`spikes/view_matrix/`** (spike 9) — everything below plus the camera-position
probe. **`spikes/vr_render/`** (spike 8) is the known-good fallback if spike 9 misbehaves.
Earlier spikes are kept deliberately; several document approaches that did *not* work, which is
most of their value.

## Quick start

```powershell
.\spikes\view_matrix\build.ps1 -Install     # builds x86, copies into the dev game copy
```

Connect **Virtual Desktop** first (VDXR is the only usable 32-bit OpenXR runtime — Meta's own
crashes in `xrCreateSession`, SteamVR has no 32-bit runtime at all), then launch:

```
R:\SingularityVR-Dev\Singularity\Binaries\Singularity.exe
```

In gameplay: **F9** head tracking · **F10** 6-DOF head position · **F12** alternate-eye stereo ·
**F6** VR-correct projection · **F8** recentre · **F5/F4** flip yaw/pitch sign ·
**F7** scan for the view matrix · **F3** constant offset probe · **F11** offset amount.
Log: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SingularityVR\view_matrix.log`. Uninstall = delete `d3d9.dll`.

Paths, toolchain and game copies: `ENVIRONMENT.md`. Nothing is tied to the repo location.

## What works, and how

| Piece | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Frame into the headset | backbuffer → `GetRenderTargetData` → SYSTEMMEM → D3D11 → XR swapchain |
| View **pitch** | MinHook detour on `FUN_0104e390`, the view-rotation source |
| View **yaw** | direct write to the live controller `+0x64` (the detour's seam carries pitch only) |
| FOV | write to `mCurrentPOV` FOV, `+0x0438` |
| Finding live objects | `GObjects` walk; live actor = `Outer == PersistentLevel`, name lacks `Default__` |

## ✅ Camera POSITION — solved 2026-07-29

This was the blocker for **both 6-DOF and stereo**, and it is now controllable. Not through the
engine's object model — three attempts at that failed — but by intercepting the **world→clip
matrix** on its way to the GPU and pre-multiplying a translation into it. Confirmed live: the
view moved.

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Where | `SetVertexShaderConstantF`, device vtable slot 94 |
| Register | `c0`, ROW storage (registers are matrix rows) |
| Space | **translated-world** — UE3 pre-subtracts the view origin on the CPU |
| To move by `o` | `row3 -= o.x*row0 + o.y*row1 + o.z*row2` |

Findings from the same runs, all in `ENGINE_NOTES.md`:

- **The engine renders in translated-world space.** Probing the world camera position alone
  would have found nothing; the origin probe is what made the scan work.
- **The convention was settled by a direction test**, not the position test — `c0` read as ROW
  gives `dotFwd = +1.0000`, read as COL gives `+0.0023`, from identical bytes.
- **CPU frustum culling is a non-issue at stereo scale.** Measured from the backbuffer: a
  1.4–2.9% band at 300 UU, and **0 px at 100 UU and below**. The planned FOV-widening job is
  therefore **dropped** — a real IPD is a few UU.

## ✅ 6-DOF — working, confirmed 2026-07-29

The headset's real position drives the view (F10). Leaning and ducking move the camera.

## Alternate-eye stereo — built, not yet run (F12)

The game renders once per frame and a D3D9 shim cannot make it render twice, so the cheap route
to two images is to alternate: this frame is drawn from the left eye, the next from the right,
each eye's swapchain holding the last image drawn for it, both submitted every frame.

Almost no new maths was needed — **an eye offset is a head position offset**, so each eye's pose
goes through exactly the same XR→game mapping 6-DOF already uses, and interpupillary distance
never appears as its own quantity. Consequence worth knowing: stereo shares that path, so it
brings positional head tracking with it whether or not F10 is on.

The cost is real and is why it is a toggle, not the default: **each eye updates at half the
frame rate**, and during fast head motion the two eyes disagree. The gain is that it is
genuinely stereo with correct occlusion — each image really was rendered from that eye's
position, not reprojected.

## VR-correct projection — flicker FIXED (confirmed run 5)

Run 4: the wider field read as far more natural, but the image pulsed — a zoom flash on the
monitor, black bars flicking top and bottom in the headset.

The log settled it. Against a steady **127.9°** requested, the matrix reported `125.3, 127.2,
125.1, 123.8, 128.7, … 80.7`. The write **works** and is not clamped, but the engine's camera
update interpolates back toward its own default between our Present-time writes, with each
step sized by frame duration — hence the 80.7° outlier on a long frame. A rendered FOV swinging
128° → 80° is a visible zoom, and submitting that narrow frustum leaves the vertical short,
which is the bars.

**Fix, confirmed:** force the frustum in the matrix (rescaling the x/y columns is exactly an FOV
change), and demote the engine's FOV to a **culling-only** hint asked for at 15% headroom. The
submitted OpenXR frustum is the same forced constant rather than the observed value, so the two
cannot disagree.

Run 5 confirms the flicker is gone. Two things the log clarified:

- The engine's drift **continues** (its FOV read back anywhere from 65° to 133.9°, its matrix
  arriving between 80° and 141°) and no longer matters, which is the point of forcing.
- Despite rendering wider than the engine culled for on many frames, the measured culling band
  stayed **0 px** throughout gameplay. UE3's per-object culling evidently carries enough slack.
  The 15% headroom stays as insurance rather than a proven necessity.

Read the log carefully on one point: the `engine's own matrix on arrival` figure measures the
matrix **before** our edit, so it reports the engine's drift, not our output. The separate
`after forcing` line is the one that verifies our own arithmetic. And the modification count is
per **draw call** using the camera matrix (~50–60 a frame is normal), not per distinct matrix.

## VR-correct projection — what it does

Scale could not be judged in the headset because the projection layer was claiming the
**headset's** FOV for an image the game rendered at a different one — a uniform stretch that
made head movement, world scale and object size all wrong together, so none could be measured
against another. Now the submitted frustum is *derived from the matrix* (read, not assumed) and
the game is asked for a vertical FOV matching the headset so that truth also fills the view.
Toggle with **F6**.

### ⏭ Next actions

1. **Test alternate-eye stereo (F12)** — does it read as depth, and is the half-rate judder
   tolerable? If it is not, the alternatives are engine re-entry (proper, hard) or depth
   reprojection.
2. **Tune `kMetresToUU`** (currently 52.5, from UE3's 16 units per foot) — the projection is now
   correct enough to judge scale against.
3. **Explain the brightness change** (run 4, deferred): the image is brighter and less blue than
   during 3-DOF testing, though not broken the way the sRGB double-encode was. Most likely UE3
   auto-exposure adapting to a much wider field, which is benign; the alternative is our
   injection touching a post-processing pass. Distinguishable by pressing F6 (projection off,
   injection still on) and seeing whether the colour returns.
4. **Performance** — the frame copy is still a full CPU round-trip, and the wide FOV now draws
   considerably more geometry. Unmeasured.

## Other known work, roughly by value

- **Performance** — the frame copy is a full CPU round-trip (~14 MB each way at 2560×1440).
  The fast path needs the game's device upgraded to D3D9Ex, which needs a
  `D3DPOOL_MANAGED` → `DEFAULT` wrapper (**10,454** allocations measured in spike 2).
- **FOV / aspect mismatch** — game renders 16:9, per-eye view is ~2496×2688.
- **Head-look vs aim are coupled** — `PlayerController.Rotation` drives both view and fire trace.
- **Menus are inert** — intended; they need OpenXR *input* (controllers, thumbsticks, laser
  pointer), which has not been touched at all. Same work unlocks motion-controller aiming.
- **GOG install crash** — a latent Raven bug (unchecked NULL from a factory) that hits on a fresh
  GOG install with missing redistributables. The install guide must warn about it.

## Method notes that earned their keep

- **Verify by writing, not by reading.** A struct holding plausible live values is not proof the
  renderer uses it. `mCurrentPOV` looked exactly like the camera and steers only FOV.
- **When guessing fails twice, change tools.** A hardware write breakpoint found the rotation
  source immediately after seven failed guesses.
- **Shotgun, then narrow.** Testing candidates one at a time behind a hotkey let a working case
  get cycled past unseen.
- **Doc errors become code bugs.** `ENGINE_NOTES` recorded the backbuffer as `X8R8G8B8`; it is
  `A8R8G8B8`, and that mistake propagated straight into a `D3DERR_INVALIDCALL`.
